Step 6: Documentation
Ensure you document your code and project. Write clear instructions on how to set up the database, run the Streamlit app, and what insights can be derived from the data.

Running The Project
Start your MySQL server and create the database.
Run the dataset generation script to populate CSV files.
Import the CSV files into the respective tables in your SQL database.
Launch the Streamlit app using:

streamlit run your_streamlit_app.py


Version Control & Error Handling
Use Git to version control your codebase.
Implement error handling in your database execution methods to catch exceptions.
Final Touches
Complete the project and optimize performance. Use meaningful comments and ensure your code follows PEP 8 standards.
